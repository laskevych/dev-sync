# DevSync API

## Description
This project is a backend API developed using Express.js for a platform called DevSync, inspired by Stack Overflow. 
The API provides functionality for users to register, log in, create questions, comment, like or dislike posts, and manage various interactions within the platform.

## Requirements
- **Node.JS** >= v22
- **NPM** >= v10
- **MySQL** >= 8.0

> üèóÔ∏è Make sure all the necessary technologies are installed before getting started.

## Database Install
The database schema is located in the [database/schema.sql](database/schema.sql) file. Execute the SQL commands in your MySQL database to create the necessary tables.

## Steps to Set Up the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Run the appropriate package manager command to install all required dependencies.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Update the `.env` file with your MySQL database credentials to set up the database connection. Example:
   ```text
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=root
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=3306
   ```

6. Log in to your MySQL instance and execute the database schema. 
7. Copy the contents of the [database/schema.sql](database/schema.sql) file and run it in your MySQL database.
Alternatively, execute the SQL commands directly via the MySQL CLI using the following command: `mysql -u {USER_NAME} -p < database/schema.sql`. Replace `{USER_NAME}` with your MySQL username and provide your password when prompted.
8. Follow the same steps as in Step 4, but use the [database/data.sql](database/data.sql)  file to populate the database with initial data.
9. Run the server to start the application.
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
